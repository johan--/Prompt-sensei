# Prompt Sensei

> Prompting is becoming one of the most important engineering skills in the AI era. Prompt Sensei helps you improve your prompts while teaching you how to improve.

[中文说明](README-zh.md)

Prompt Sensei is a quiet, local-first prompt coach for Claude Code and Codex, including IDE/plugin environments that can load those skills. It gives stage-aware feedback, rewrites rough prompts into better ones, looks back on local history when you ask, and helps you practice one habit at a time.

No cloud. No telemetry. No leaderboard. No raw prompt archive.

## Why This Exists

AI coding agents do real work: they edit files, run commands, and make implementation choices. A vague prompt does not just produce a vague answer; it can produce broad edits, hidden assumptions, and extra revision loops.

Prompt Sensei is built around a simple belief:

- Prompting is an engineering skill.
- Engineering skills improve through feedback.
- Feedback should be kind, specific, private, and useful.

It does not treat `fix this test` as a bad prompt. It treats it as an early-stage prompt, then teaches the next step.

## 5-Minute Quickstart

Install for Claude Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chengzhongwei/Prompt-sensei ~/.claude/skills/prompt-sensei
(cd ~/.claude/skills/prompt-sensei && npm install && npm run build)
```

Install for Codex:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chengzhongwei/Prompt-sensei ~/.codex/skills/prompt-sensei
(cd ~/.codex/skills/prompt-sensei && npm install && npm run build)
```

Start live coaching:

```txt
/prompt-sensei observe
```

Try improving a rough prompt:

```txt
/prompt-sensei improve "fix this test"
```

Example output:

```txt
Prompt Sensei Improve
=====================
Stage:    Exploration
Score:    70 / 100  (Good)

What is missing:
  - failing test name
  - expected behavior
  - actual error output

Improved prompt:
  Help me debug this failing test.

  Test: [test name]
  Expected: [what should happen]
  Actual: [error output or wrong behavior]
  Related file: [file path]

  Return:
  1. Likely root cause
  2. Minimal fix
  3. Test command to verify

Habit to practice next:
  Add expected and actual behavior before asking for a fix.
```

See [examples/prompt-gallery.md](examples/prompt-gallery.md) for more copyable before/after prompts.

## Supported Environments

Prompt Sensei works best when the host tool can load the skill directly.

| Invocation style | Environments |
|---|---|
| Direct skill command, e.g. `/prompt-sensei improve "fix this test"` | Claude Code and compatible Claude Code skill environments |
| Natural language, e.g. `Use prompt-sensei to improve this prompt...` | Codex and IDE/plugin environments where slash commands are not available |

If Claude Code or Codex is running inside an IDE plugin and can access the installed skill, use the same Prompt Sensei workflow there.

---

## Commands

```txt
/prompt-sensei [observe|stop|improve|lookback|report|help|clear|update]
```

```txt
/prompt-sensei observe              # start live coaching
/prompt-sensei stop                 # stop coaching this session
/prompt-sensei improve "fix this"   # rewrite a prompt with one teaching note
/prompt-sensei lookback             # analyze selected local prompt history
/prompt-sensei report               # show local session trends
/prompt-sensei update               # pull latest version and rebuild
/prompt-sensei clear                # delete local Prompt Sensei data
/prompt-sensei help
```

For Codex, use natural language:

```txt
Use prompt-sensei to improve this prompt: "fix this test"
Use prompt-sensei to look back at my recent prompts.
Use prompt-sensei to show my report.
```

## How It Teaches

Prompt Sensei is stage-aware. A short exploration prompt can be reasonable early, while an execution prompt needs clearer context, boundaries, and verification.

| Stage | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Exploration | Still figuring out the problem | `why is this broken` |
| Diagnosis | Have evidence or symptoms | `expected /login, actual /dashboard` |
| Execution | Want implementation or changes | `implement this with these constraints` |
| Verification | Want correctness checks | `find edge cases and test commands` |
| Reusable workflow | Want a repeatable process | `create a code review checklist` |
| Action | Short follow-through directive | `ok commit and push to main` |

The coaching line stays small:

> **[Sensei: 68/100 · Diagnosis; Tip: add the error message and file path]**

The report focuses on growth:

```txt
Average score:    81 / 100  (Good)
Most common type: implementation
Next habit:       End prompts with the exact test command or edge cases.
```

For the full philosophy, read [docs/philosophy.md](docs/philosophy.md). For scoring details, read [docs/scoring-rubric.md](docs/scoring-rubric.md).

---

## Lookback

`/prompt-sensei lookback` analyzes selected local Claude Code or Codex history after separate consent.

It can:

- find recent Claude Code and Codex sessions
- analyze one session or all sessions
- generate one-by-one coaching or a full lookback report
- save a markdown report only after confirmation

Lookback reads raw history locally, redacts user prompts before analysis, and does not store raw history, prompt hashes, or derived metadata by default.

---

## Optional Claude Code Hook

Add a `UserPromptSubmit` hook to `~/.claude/settings.json` to record hash-only prompt metadata in the background after consent:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node ~/.claude/skills/prompt-sensei/dist/scripts/observe.js --hash-only",
            "async": true,
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Hook captures are excluded from scoring because hooks do not have enough conversation context to classify the prompt or choose a coaching tip.

## Privacy

Prompt content is sensitive. Prompt Sensei stores nothing until you consent.

After consent, it stores local metadata only:

- `~/.prompt-sensei/events.jsonl` — observation log
- `~/.prompt-sensei/config.json` — consent record
- `~/.prompt-sensei/update-check.json` — cached update status
- `~/.prompt-sensei/reports/` — optional saved lookback reports

Prompt Sensei's local scripts do not send prompt text, scores, reports, or local event data to a service. Lookback may show redacted user prompts to the current AI agent after separate consent.

See [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md) for details.

## Contributing

Good first areas:

- realistic prompt improvement examples
- scoring rubric improvements
- redaction rule improvements
- report improvements

Please keep changes aligned with the core philosophy: quiet, local-first, encouraging, and privacy-aware.
