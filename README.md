# Prompt Sensei

> A quiet, local-first prompt mentor for engineers using AI coding tools.

Prompt Sensei helps developers improve their AI prompts over time with gentle, stage-aware feedback.

It is not a leaderboard.
It is not employee surveillance.
It is not prompt police.

It is a small Claude Code skill and local prompt-coaching toolkit that helps engineers turn rough intent into clear, effective, work-ready prompts.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chengzhongwei/Prompt-sensei ~/.claude/skills/prompt-sensei
(cd ~/.claude/skills/prompt-sensei && npm install && npm run build)
```

Claude Code picks up skills in `~/.claude/skills/` automatically.

### Use as a Claude Code skill

```
/prompt-sensei [observe|stop|report|review|help|clear]
```

With no arguments, starts observation mode by default — scores your prompts quietly as you work.

```
/prompt-sensei observe          # start scoring
/prompt-sensei stop             # stop scoring this session
/prompt-sensei review "help me fix this"
/prompt-sensei report
/prompt-sensei help
```

### Optional: Enable local prompt observation

Add to your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "node ~/.claude/skills/prompt-sensei/dist/scripts/observe.js",
        "async": true,
        "timeout": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The observer writes local metadata to `~/.prompt-sensei/events.jsonl`.

Generate a report:

```bash
npm run report
```

Clear local data:

```bash
npm run clear-data
```

## Why Prompt Sensei?

AI-assisted engineering is becoming a daily workflow. But most teams still struggle with prompts like:

```txt
fix this
why is this broken
make it better
```

These prompts are not "wrong." They are often just early-stage thoughts.

Prompt Sensei helps developers gradually improve by asking:

- Was this an exploration prompt?
- Was this ready for implementation?
- Did it include enough context?
- Did it define the expected output?
- Did it include verification steps?
- Did the user improve compared with previous prompts?

The goal is not perfect prompting. The goal is better AI-assisted work.

## What Makes Prompt Sensei Different?

Most prompt tools try to rewrite your prompt. Prompt Sensei is different.

| Feature | Prompt Sensei |
|---|---|
| Quiet by default | Does not interrupt your flow |
| Local-first | No cloud backend required |
| Privacy-aware | Does not store raw prompts by default |
| Stage-aware | Does not punish early exploratory prompts |
| Encouraging | Gives teacher-like feedback, not harsh grades |
| Engineering-focused | Built for debugging, coding, code review, planning, docs, and architecture |
| Growth-oriented | Tracks improvement patterns over time |

Prompt Sensei understands that this:

```
why is auth broken
```

may be a totally reasonable exploration prompt. But once more context is known, it can help you grow toward this:

```
Please debug this failing Jest test.
Goal:
  Find why unauthenticated users are redirected to /dashboard instead of /login.
Context:
  - Stack: TypeScript, React, Jest
  - Recent change: added refresh-token support
  - Related files:
    - src/middleware/auth.ts
    - src/routes/ProtectedRoute.tsx
    - src/__tests__/auth.test.ts
Expected:
  If the user has no access token and no refresh token, redirect to /login.
Actual:
  The test receives /dashboard.
Constraints:
  - Do not refactor the whole auth flow.
  - Prefer the smallest safe fix.
  - If the test expectation is wrong, explain why before changing it.
Return:
  1. Root cause
  2. Proposed fix
  3. Patch summary
  4. Test command
  5. Edge cases to verify
```

That is the difference between a vague request and a work-ready AI prompt.

---

## Prompt Stages

Prompt Sensei does not treat every prompt the same.

| Stage | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Exploration | You are still figuring out the problem | `why is this broken` |
| Diagnosis | You have evidence or symptoms | `expected /login, actual /dashboard` |
| Execution | You want implementation or changes | `implement this with these constraints` |
| Verification | You want correctness checks | `find edge cases and test commands` |
| Reusable workflow | You want a repeatable process | `create a code review checklist` |
| Action | Short follow-through directive in an established session | `ok commit and push to main`, `run the tests` |

A vague prompt may be fine during exploration, but not enough for execution. Action prompts are never scored on Constraints, Verification, or Output Format — those dimensions don't apply to operational directives.

---

## Scoring Dimensions

Prompt Sensei scores prompts across seven practical dimensions:

| Dimension | What it checks |
|---|---|
| Goal clarity | Is the desired outcome clear? |
| Context completeness | Did the user provide enough background? |
| Input boundaries | Is the relevant input clear? |
| Constraints | Are scope and tradeoffs defined? |
| Output format | Did the user specify the desired structure? |
| Verification | Did the user ask how to check correctness? |
| Privacy/safety | Did the prompt avoid unnecessary sensitive data? |

Scores are used for private feedback and trend tracking, not public ranking.

## Demo

**Beginner prompt**

```
fix this test
```

**Prompt Sensei feedback**

```
Prompt stage:    Exploration
Score:           2.0 / 5  (as execution-ready)
                 3.5 / 5  (as exploration)

What is good:
  You clearly indicated you need debugging help.

What is missing:
  - failing test output
  - expected behavior
  - actual behavior
  - related files
  - verification command

Suggested rewrite:
  Please debug this failing Jest test.
  Context:
    - Stack: TypeScript, React, Jest
    - Related file: src/__tests__/auth.test.ts
    - Expected: unauthenticated users redirect to /login
    - Actual: test redirects to /dashboard
  Return:
    1. Root cause
    2. Minimal fix
    3. Test command
    4. Edge cases to verify

Habit to practice next:
  Add expected behavior and actual behavior to every debugging prompt.
```

---

## Example Progress Over Time

Prompt Sensei is designed to notice improvement.

**Day 1:** `"fix this test"`
Feedback: Good starting point, but missing context and verification.

**Day 2:** `"A Jest test is failing. Expected /login, actual /dashboard."`
Feedback: Nice improvement. You added expected vs actual behavior.

**Day 4:**
```
Please debug this failing Jest test. Context: TypeScript, React, Jest.
Recent change: added refresh-token support. Expected no token redirects to /login.
Actual: redirects to /dashboard. Do not refactor the auth flow. Return root cause,
minimal fix, test command, and edge cases.
```
Feedback: Excellent. This is now execution-ready.

Prompt Sensei does not just ask "Was this prompt good?" It asks "Is the user learning?"

---

## How It Works

### 1. Claude Code Skill

Use it on demand:

```
/prompt-sensei
```

or:

```
/prompt-sensei review this prompt:
"fix this test"
```

The skill gives feedback on prompt stage, task type, clarity, context, constraints, output format, verification, privacy/safety, a suggested rewrite, and one habit to practice next.

### 2. Observe Mode — Inline Scoring

Activate observation mode to get a live score after every prompt you send:

```
/prompt-sensei observe
```

After each message, Prompt Sensei appends a one-line score at the end of its response:

> **[[Sensei: Score - 68/100; Tip: add the error message and file path]]()**

When your prompt is excellent:

> **[[Sensei: Score - 94/100; Excellent — execution-ready prompt]]()**

The score is calculated from 7 dimensions on a 1–5 scale, converted to /100. The tip always names the single most impactful improvement — one habit at a time, not a list.

Scores by stage:

| Score | Grade | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 90–100 | Excellent | Execution-ready |
| 70–89 | Good | Minor gaps |
| 50–69 | Developing | Clear improvements available |
| 30–49 | Early stage | Normal for exploration |
| 10–29 | Needs work | Start with goal clarity |

Action prompts (short follow-through directives) are only scored on Goal Clarity and Privacy/Safety — never penalized for missing Constraints, Verification, or Output Format.

To stop observation for the current session:

```
/prompt-sensei stop
```

To see your session statistics:

```
/prompt-sensei report
```

To clear local data:

```
/prompt-sensei clear
```

### 3. Optional Local Observer

Prompt Sensei can optionally observe Claude Code prompts through a local hook, recording metadata silently in the background without needing the skill to be active.

The observer:

- reads prompt events locally
- redacts sensitive data (emails, API keys, tokens)
- hashes prompts
- classifies prompt stage
- scores prompt quality
- stores lightweight metadata locally
- generates private reports

By default, it does not store raw prompts.

---

## Good Prompt Pattern

Prompt Sensei encourages this simple structure:

```
Goal:         What do you want?
Context:      What should the AI know?
Input:        What should the AI use?
Constraints:  What should the AI avoid or prioritize?
Output:       How should the answer be structured?
Verification: How should correctness be checked?
```

---

## Privacy Model

Prompt Sensei is privacy-first by design.

**Default behavior:**
- no cloud backend
- no telemetry
- no login
- no leaderboard
- no raw prompt storage

By default, Prompt Sensei stores only: timestamp, task type, prompt stage, prompt hash, scores, and lightweight feedback tags.

Two files are created locally on first use:
- `~/.prompt-sensei/events.jsonl` — observation log
- `~/.prompt-sensei/config.json` — consent record (created once)

Raw prompt storage is opt-in only:

```bash
PROMPT_SENSEI_STORE_RAW=1 npm run observe
```

Even then, Prompt Sensei attempts to redact emails, API keys, tokens, private keys, and URLs with query parameters before storing.

See [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md) for full details.

## Example Report

```
# Prompt Sensei Report
Observed 18 prompts in the last 7 days.

**Average score:**     68 / 100  (Developing)
**Trend:**             ↑  6 pts vs previous 5 prompts
**Most common type:**  debugging
**Most common stage:** diagnosis

**Score history:**     ▂▃▃▄▄▄▅▅▆▆

## Most common gaps
- missing-context (7×)
- no-verification (5×)
- no-constraints (3×)

## Stage breakdown
- diagnosis: 9 (50%)
- execution: 6 (33%)
- exploration: 3 (17%)

## Feedback
Your scores are trending upward. The practice is working.
You are in the developing stage. The gap between where you are and 'good' is smaller than it feels.

Main growth area: Try adding the error message or stack trace to every debugging prompt.
```

## Who Is This For?

Prompt Sensei is for:

- engineers using Claude Code
- teams adopting AI coding tools
- developers who want better AI results
- people learning prompt engineering through practice

It is especially useful for prompts involving: debugging, implementation, code review, refactoring, architecture, planning, documentation, and tests.

---

## What This Is Not

Prompt Sensei is not:

- a prompt marketplace
- a prompt optimizer for marketing copy
- a production LLM eval platform
- an employee monitoring tool
- a replacement for engineering judgment

It is a small, local mentor for building better prompting habits.

---
